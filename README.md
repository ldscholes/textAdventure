Here's a simple example of a Python text adventure game with combat.

When the player chooses to explore an area, the loop first checks if there are any enemies in the current area. If there are, the player enters into combat with a randomly selected enemy using the combat function. If the player wins the combat, they gain gold and the enemy is removed from the area's enemy list. If the player loses, they lose all their gold and are sent back to the town area.

When the player chooses to visit the shop, the loop first checks if the current area has a shop. If it does, the loop enters a nested loop that displays different purchasing options (weapons or spells) and allows the player to buy them using their gold. If the player buys a weapon, their attack power is increased, and if they buy a spell, it is added to their spell list.

When the player chooses to change areas, the loop displays a list of all available areas and allows the player to choose one.

The game also has a leveling and experience point system. As the player gains experience points by defeating enemies, they will level up and become stronger, with their maximum health and mana increasing and their attack and defense stats improving. The player can also learn new spells as they level up.

Finally, when the player chooses to quit, the loop breaks and the game ends.

Overall, this main game loop ties together all the different functions and mechanics of the game, allowing the player to explore different areas, engage in combat, buy items, and progress through the game.
